- 👋 Hi, I’m @Manley-Mama-T
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all things related to coding and data science/analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html with CSS, data analytics basics, as well as the basics for excel.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything at the moment. I'm just looking to hone my skills, learn more, and gain experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can reach me on here through the mail.
- A little about me: I am a military spouse and mother to five beautiful children. I am looking to expand my skills in coding, data science and analytics. I am hoping to build my portfolio right now so that in the next year or two, I can pursue an entry level job, preferably part-time and remote. This is my goal since my husband's job is unpredictable and I need my schedule to be flexible around his job and my kids.
